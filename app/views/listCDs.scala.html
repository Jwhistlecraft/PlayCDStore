 @* the template file is like a function and therefore it can have expected arguments *@
 @* in this case it is expecting a collection of CD's for us to display  *@
 @* it also expects a form of type CD *@
 @* then we have the implicit messages in the second set of arguments *@
 @* the implicit messages is required for the form helper to build up the form *@
 @* due to the plays ability of supporting internationalisation *@

 @* Some HTML code to list out the CD's that we passed in a table with two columns *@

 @* helper.form basically replaces the need for you to define the form in HTML *@
 @* we start by using the helper.form and inside the parentheses we define where this form *@
 @* will be posted to *@
 @* after that we define the input text fields to which we pass the form which was passed by the  *@
 @* controller method and define that this inputText field is the name field which we need for our CD case class *@
 @* additionally we are able to pass other fields for when the text field is created so that the HTML for it  *@
 @* would have a specific id and a class set *@
 @* if you don't want to define the additional fields then you can just pass the form and to which case class  *@
 @* field this maps to *@
 @* lastly we have a button to actually submit this form *@
 @* an example of how we can pass additional arguments for the helper *@
 @* in this CD example having '_showConstraints -> false will hide the requirement Required *@

 @* This helper will generate the HTML for this form and it will look like this *@
 @* <form action="/cds" method="POST">
 <dl class=" " id="name_field">
 <dt><label for="name">Name</label></dt>
 <dd>
 <input type="text" id="name" name="name" value="">
 </dd>
 </dl>
 <dl class=" " id="price_field">
 <dt><label for="price">Price</label></dt>
 <dd>
 <input type="text" id="price" name="price" value="">
 </dd>
 </dl>
 <button type="submit">Create CD</button>
 </form> *@
